# Software Development Methodology

Methodology: Agile - Mini-Sprint Iterative Model

# Why Agile?

- Allows short development sprints with incremental outputs
- Encourages early testing and feedback
- Promotes flexibility and continuous improvement

# Agile Phases

1. Planning  
   Define project goals, user roles, and break down tasks into sprints.

2. Design  
   Create wireframes, system diagrams, and plan a mobile-first user interface.

3. Development  
   Develop features sprint by sprint using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL.

4. Testing  
   QA tester verifies each module per sprint and identifies issues early.

5. Deployment  
   Deployed locally via XAMPP and can be hosted online if needed.
